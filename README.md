# Simon-Game - Memory Challenge
A simple Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript where players must remember and repeat a sequence of highlighted boxes.
The game starts by flashing a random box, and with each round, the sequence grows longer. Each correct attempt extends the sequence, increasing the difficulty.
If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, displaying their score and allowing them to restart.
The game keeps track of the highest score using local storage.
